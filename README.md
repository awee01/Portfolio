# React Portfolio

This application is a react version of my html portfolio that I created in the second week of this course

**New additions are:**

Scroll functionality courtesy of react-scroll

A new Resume section with a link to my Resume and qualifications that I have learned during my bootcamp experience, 

An updated contact me section with a submit form,

A Footer with links to my github and social media
